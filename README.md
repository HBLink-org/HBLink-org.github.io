Welcome to the home of HBLink: HomeBrew repeater protocol networking tools

## Description

HBlink provides a suite of programs for building and extending existing networks that use the Home-brew Repeater Protocol and OpenBridge protocols. These protocols are most commonly associated with MMDVM and the Brandmeister and DMR+ networks.

The hblink3 repository is where current development is taking place, and is the Python 3 version of this project.

HBlink is _not_ a "plug and play" program to build DMR networks. It is a collection of programs built on top of a common protocol stack contained in hblink.py.

These are Python 3 applications. To use them, you will need some pre-requisite knowledge of how Python applications and modules work together, and you'll need basic skills using a command line interface in unix-like operating systems.

## Available Tools

The project currently manages five tools between two Python versions:

 - [`hblink3`](https://github.com/HBLink-org/hblink3) -- Current development of HBLink under Python 3
 - [`dmr_utils3`](https://github.com/HBLink-org/dmr_utils3) -- Current development of DMR utilities, also using Python 3
 - [`HBLink`](https://github.com/HBLink-org/HBLink) -- Mostly archived repo, containing essential branch `HB_Bridge` for legacy homebrew repeater connections, built on Python 2.x
 - [`DMRlink`](https://github.com/HBLink-org/DMRlink) -- Mostly archive repo, containing the essential branch `IPSC_Bridge` for legacy IPSC (Motorola) repeater connections, built on Python 2.x
 - [`dmr_utils`](https://github.com/HBLink-org/dmr_utils) -- Former DMR utilities repo, built using Python 2.x
 
 More tools or variations will be available as new development continues.
