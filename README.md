Welcome to the home of HBLink: HomeBrew repeater protocol networking tools

## Description

HBlink provides a suite of programs for building and extending existing networks that use the Home-brew Repeater Protocol and OpenBridge protocols. These protocols are most commonly associated with MMDVM and the Brandmeister and DMR+ networks.

The hblink3 repository is where current development is taking place, and is the Python 3 version of this project.

HBlink is _not_ a "plug and play" program to build DMR networks. It is a collection of programs built on top of a common protocol stack contained in hblink.py.

These are Python 3 applications. To use them, you will need some pre-requisite knowledge of how Python applications and modules work together, and you'll need basic skills using a command line interface in unix-like operating systems.
